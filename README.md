Soleil allows you to view current sunrise/sunset times from your terminal.
Soleil uses the OS X Core Location framework to calculate your current
position, so it requires OS X.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install -g soleil
```

calculations and [node-corelocation](https://github.com/tmcw/node-corelocation)
